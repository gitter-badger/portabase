Windows Development Environment
-------------------------------
To compile PortaBase for use as a Windows desktop application, you will
need the following:
- Windows XP, Vista, or 7
- The latest Qt SDK (from http://qt.nokia.com/downloads).  You'll need this
  even if it doesn't have the very latest version of the Qt framework, because
  it's the easiest way to install an appropriate version of the MinGW
  compiler.  Add both the "bin" directory and the "mingw\bin" directory that
  come with it to your "Path" environment variable.  If you want to use a
  version of the Qt framework newer than the one bundled with the SDK,
  download and install the appropriate version and put its "bin" directory in
  your path instead of the one from the SDK.
- MSYS 1.0.11 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MSYS%20Base%20System/msys-1.0.11/MSYS-1.0.11.exe/download).
  This emulates a basic UNIX system on Windows, and is the easiest way to
  compile Metakit with MinGW.  Newer versions are available, but lack a
  convenient installer; this one should work fine.
- Inno Setup, if you wish to create the PortaBase installer; available from:
  http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php

Metakit Compilation
-------------------
To compile PortaBase, Metakit (http://www.equi4.com/metakit/) must be compiled
first.  PortaBase uses a version of 2.4.9.7 patched to allow case-sensitive
searches and locale-sensitive sorting; the patched version is included in the
"metakit" directory for convenience (and to support the Debian and Maemo
autobuilders).

To compile Metakit for Windows, first install the Qt SDK in order to get the
MinGW compiler.  Then install MSYS as mentioned above; in the postinstallation
script, you'll be asked for the path of the MinGW installation that came with
Qt.  Start MSYS from the installed shortcut, and change to the metakit/builds
directory that is included with the PortaBase source code.  Note that you use
"cd" to change directories, use "/" as the directory separator, and the C:
drive is located at "/c".  From the metakit/builds directory, run
"../unix/configure --enable-threads --disable-shared".  Once that finishes, run
"make".  You should now have a libmk4.a static library file in that directory.

Installing Python and Sphinx
----------------------------
If you want to generate the help files and/or a PortaBase installer, you'll
need to install these.  Download the latest Python 2 installer from
http://www.python.org/download/ and run it.  Then download the appropriate
installer for setuptools from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/ and run
that also.  Open a new DOS prompt and run "C:\Python27\Scripts\easy_install
pip" (change the path as necessary) to install a more capable python package
manager.  Finally, running "C:\Python27\Scripts\pip install Sphinx" will
install Sphinx and all the other Python libraries that it depends on.

PortaBase Compilation and Packaging
-----------------------------------
- Compile Metakit as described above.
- Open a command prompt, and change to the root directory of the downloaded
  PortaBase source code.  If this isn't at "C:\portabase", you'll have to
  change the paths for "LIBS" and "INCLUDEPATH" in portabase.pro.
- From that directory run "packaging\windows\build.bat"; this will generate a
  working PortaBase.exe file in the "build" directory.
- If you want to create an installer for PortaBase, first install Inno Setup,
  Python, and Sphinx (for the help pages, as described in PortaBase's INSTALL
  file).  Then run "packaging\windows\installer.bat"; you may need to edit it
  first in order to adjust the paths to Qt and/or Inno Setup. This will
  generate an executable installer in the "build/windows" directory.
