Using cppcheck
--------------

The static code analysis tool cppcheck is used during development to catch any
code constructs that seem likely to cause bugs or cause poor performance.  To
run the checks, first install cppcheck by following the instructions for your
platform at http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/.  Then, after confirming that
cppcheck is in your PATH, run the following from the project root:

packaging/cppcheck/cppcheck.sh (if on Linux/UNIX)
packaging/cppcheck/cppcheck.bat (if on Windows)
