Mac OS X Development Environment
--------------------------------
To compile PortaBase for use as a Mac OS X desktop application, you will
need the following:
- Mac OS X Tiger (10.4) or higher; Leopard (10.5) or higher for Cocoa and/or
  64-bit support
- Xcode (if running Xcode 4, be sure to install the command line utilities
  from Preferences -> Downloads)
- A recent version of Qt (https://www.qt.io/download/); 4.8 or higher is
  recommended.

Metakit Compilation
-------------------
To compile PortaBase, Metakit (http://www.equi4.com/metakit/) must be compiled
first.  PortaBase uses a version of 2.4.9.7 patched to allow case-sensitive
searches and locale-sensitive sorting; the patched version is included in the
"metakit" directory for convenience (and to support the Debian and Maemo
autobuilders).

To compile Metakit for Mac OS X, from the root PortaBase source directory run
"packaging/mac/build_metakit.sh"; it'll prompt you for your password near the
end in order to install the files under /usr/local where they will be found
later when compiling PortaBase.  Note that this script is configured assuming
that you're on Leopard or later, compiling only for Intel 64-bit processors;
supporting Tiger, PowerPC processors, or 32-bit Intel processors requires some
additional effort (especially if you're using Xcode 4 instead of an earlier
version).

Help Pages Generation
---------------------
If you don't already have the "pip" installer for Python packages installed,
do so by running "sudo easy_install pip".  Then install Sphinx by running
"sudo pip install Sphinx".  You'll also need GNU gettext to process the help
file translations; you can download a binary version from
http://www.ellert.se/twain-sane/ or install it using MacPorts.

To be able to automatically download the latest help page translations from
Transifex, also run "sudo pip install transifex-client".  Use the script at
packaging/generate_help.sh to generate the help files; see the top of the
script for usage information.

PortaBase compilation
---------------------
- Install a recent version of Qt as described above.
- Make sure the Metakit static library (libmk4.a) is in /usr/local/lib, and
  that the other library files (.dylib, .la, etc.) aren't.
- From the root PortaBase source directory run "packaging/mac/build.sh"; this
  will generate a self-contained PortaBase.app and a PortaBase.dmg installer.
  You'll need the libraries for help file generation installed as described
  above.
