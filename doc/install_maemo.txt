Maemo Development Environment
-----------------------------
To compile PortaBase for Maemo portable devices (Nokia N810, N900, etc.), you
will need a suitable development environment.  The easiest way to get one set
up is to use one of the preconfigured virtual images from
http://maemovmware.garage.maemo.org/2nd_edition/.  See that site for more
documentation on how to use those virtual machines.

Metakit Compilation
-------------------
To compile PortaBase, Metakit (http://www.equi4.com/metakit/) must be compiled
first.  PortaBase uses a version of 2.4.9.7 patched to allow case-sensitive
searches and locale-sensitive sorting; the patched version is included in the
"metakit" directory for convenience (and to support the Debian and Maemo
autobuilders).

To build Metakit for Maemo, follow the Metakit installation instructions (in
the Metakit README file) inside the appropriate Scratchbox environment.  You'll
want to pass the "--enable-threads" and "--disable-shared" parameters to the
configure script.

PortaBase  Compilation
----------------------
After compiling Metakit as described above, PortaBase can be compiled in the
usual manner for Maemo Qt applications.  See the Maemo SDK documentation for
more information.

Maemo Package Building
----------------------
- Make sure that Scratchbox has access to the PortaBase source code, with the
  help files already generated on the host system by running
  packaging/maemo/generate_help.sh
- Log in to Scratchbox (by running /scratchbox/login from a terminal), and
  select the desired target with sb-menu
- From the root PortaBase source directory, run "packaging/maemo/diablo.sh"
  (if generating a package for Diablo); the .deb will be generated in the
  "build/diablo" directory.  The "packaging/maemo/fremantle.sh" script will
  similarly generate a package for Fremantle.
