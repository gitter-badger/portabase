Maemo Development Environment
-----------------------------
To compile PortaBase for Maemo portable devices (Nokia N810, N900, etc.), you
will need a suitable development environment.  I use ESbox
(http://esbox.garage.maemo.org/2nd_edition/), but you should also be able to
use the Maemo SDK directly (either on a Linux system or in a Linux virtual
machine via VMWare, VirtualBox, etc.)  For Maemo 5 development, MADDE
(https://wiki.maemo.org/MADDE) may work as well; at the time of this writing,
it doesn't yet seem to support compiling Qt applications for Maemo 4.

Metakit Compilation
-------------------
To compile PortaBase, Metakit (http://www.equi4.com/metakit/) must be compiled
first.  PortaBase uses a version of 2.4.9.7 patched to allow case-sensitive
searches and locale-sensitive sorting; the patched version is included in the
"metakit" directory for convenience (and to support the Debian and Maemo
autobuilders).

To build Metakit for Maemo, follow the Metakit installation instructions (in
the Metakit README file) inside the appropriate Scratchbox environment.  You'll
want to pass the "--enable-threads" and "--disable-shared" parameters to the
configure script.

PortaBase  Compilation
----------------------
After compiling Metakit as described above, PortaBase can be compiled in the
usual manner for Maemo Qt applications.  See the ESbox (or Maemo SDK, or MADDE)
documentation for more information.

Maemo Package Building
----------------------
- Make sure that Scratchbox has access to the PortaBase source code
- Log in to Scratchbox, and select the desired target with sb-menu
- From the root PortaBase source directory, run "packaging/maemo/diablo.sh"
  (if generating a package for Diablo); the .deb will be generated in the
  "build/diablo" directory.  The "packaging/maemo/fremantle.sh" script will
  similarly generate a package for Fremantle.
