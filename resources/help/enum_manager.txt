Enum manager
============

PortaBase supports enum (enumeration) column types, in which each value in the column is one of a set of possible string values.  The enum manager dialog lets you create, edit, delete, and change the listing order of these enums.

Most of the dialog is occupied by a list of the currently defined enums. There is a row of buttons identical to those in the :ref:`columns editor <columns_editor>`:

**Add**
  Launch the :ref:`enum editor <enum_editor>` to define a new enum.  Note that the new enum will be added when "OK"/"Done" is clicked in the editor dialog, not when the "OK"/"Done" button is clicked in this dialog.
  
**Edit**
  Launch the enum editor to edit the currently selected enum.  As when adding, edits are applied as soon as "OK"/"Done" is clicked in the editor dialog.
  
**Delete**
  Delete the currently selected enum.  If there are columns of this enum type, a dialog will warn you that these would also be deleted and ask if you want to continue.  The enum (and any associated colums) will be deleted immediately, not when "OK"/"Done" is clicked.
  
**Up**
  Move the currently selected enum up one position in the list (and hence in the column editor's type list as well).
  
**Down**
  Move the currently selected enum down one position in the list (and hence in the column editor's type list as well).

Click "OK"/"Done" to apply any changes made to the enum listing order, or cancel out of the dialog to leave the sequence unchanged (other than any added or deleted enums).
