File selector
=============

Unless the program was launched by clicking on a PortaBase file, the first screen shown will be the file selector.  You may choose one of the following options from the "File" menu, toolbar, or main display buttons:

**New**
  Create a new file (possibly :ref:`encrypted <encryption>`)

**Open**
  Open a dialog to select a file to open

**Open Recent/Recently opened files**
  A list of recently opened files; click on one to open that file.

**Import**
  Create a new file (possibly :ref:`encrypted <encryption>`) from the data in an XML or MobileDB file.  You will be prompted for the type of file to import, the file to import, then a name for the new file to create.  See the PortaBase home page for more information about the XML format used.

**Preferences**
  Launch the :ref:`preferences dialog <preferences>`.

**Fullscreen**
  Click this toolbar button to switch PortaBase to fullscreen mode or back to normal display mode.

**Quit**
  Close PortaBase.
