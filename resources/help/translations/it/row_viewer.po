"The row viewer is a dialog designed to conveniently see all of the data for "
"one row at a time.  Like the row editor, it has the column labels on the "
"left and values on the right.  But the values are not editable, and they "
"wrap so you don't have to scroll horizontally to see everything.  The "
"complete content of note fields is shown as well, instead of just the first "
"few words.  By default, only the columns in the current view are shown (in "
"the view-specified order); to see a different set of columns, select the "
"appropriate view from the droplist at the bottom of the dialog.  Pressing "
"the left and right arrows at the bottom of the screen or the left and right "
"arrow keys allows you to navigate between rows in the current view.  There "
"are a few other buttons buttons at the bottom of the dialog:"
