"Choose the format you want to export to from the droplist.  If you export to"
" CSV or HTML, only the rows passing the current filter will be exported.  "
"Additionally, when exporting to HTML only the columns included in the "
"current view will be exported.  If you export to XML, the entire database "
"structure (including column definitions, views, filters, etc.) will be "
"exported; note that the result may be over twice the size of the actual data"
" file, so make sure you have enough free storage space."
