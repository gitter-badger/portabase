"Because memory was limited on the Zaurus PDAs for which PortaBase was "
"originally developed, very large pictures will be rejected.  JPEG images "
"larger than 6400 x 4800 pixels cannot be imported, and ones larger than 800 "
"x 600 will be shrunk to at most that size.  Similarly, PNG images larger "
"than 800 x 600 cannot be imported.  These limitations will be removed in a "
"future version of PortaBase, since it is no longer being developed for the "
"Zaurus."
