"The image viewer is a simple dialog that displays the image contained in one"
" field of an Image column.  If launched from the :ref:`data viewer "
"<data_viewer>`, the left arrow key shows the image in the same column from "
"the previous row in the current filter; similarly, the right arrow key shows"
" the image from the next row.  Double-clicking on the image shows it in "
"fullscreen mode; click on the fullscreen image again to close the viewer.  "
"When viewing a fullscreen image (including slideshows) on Maemo Fremantle, "
"the image will auto-rotate to match the current orientation of the device."
