"Whenever you browse a database's content in the :ref:`data viewer "
"<data_viewer>`, you are looking at one \"view\" of the data.  A view is a "
"subset of the columns in the database, displayed in a particular order and "
"with specified display widths.  Each database has a default \"All Columns\" "
"view which shows all the columns in the database in the same order as they "
"appear in the :ref:`row editor <row_editor>`."

"Views are defined using the view editor dialog.  At the top of the dialog is"
" a text box containing the name of the view; changing this renames the view."
"  Next are droplists allowing you to pick a default sorting and/or filter "
"that will be applied whenever you switch to this view; selecting \"No "
"default sorting\" and \"No default filter\" leaves the current sorting and "
"filter unchanged.  (This avoids the need to select a view, then a sorting, "
"then a filter if there are certain combinations of these that you use "
"often.)  Below those is a table showing the names of all the columns in the "
"database, with a checkbox next to each indicating whether or not it is "
"included in this view.  Click this checkbox to include or exclude the "
"column.  There are \"Up\" and \"Down\" buttons for moving the selected row "
"up or down in the table, changing the order of the columns in the view.  "
"Click \"OK\"/\"Done\" to accept the currently shown settings, or cancel out "
"of the dialog to revert to the previous values (or to cancel adding a new "
"view)."
