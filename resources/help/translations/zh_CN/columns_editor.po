"Each PortaBase file contains one table of a user-defined format.  The format"
" of this table is determined by a sequence of data columns, each of which "
"has its own name, data type, and default value. When creating a new "
"PortaBase file, this dialog is shown so the data columns can be defined.  "
"The columns of an existing file can also be edited at any time using this "
"dialog by selecting the \"Edit Columns\" menu item (in the :ref:`data viewer"
" <data_viewer>`, under the \"File\" menu except on Maemo where the menus are"
" flattened)."
