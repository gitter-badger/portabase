"This dialog allows you to define columns which contain values calculated "
"from the values of other columns in the same row.  It is launched by "
"pressing the \"Edit calculation\" button in the column editor, which appears"
" only for columns of type \"Calculation\".  At the top of the dialog are the"
" name of the column, a read-only display of the current calculation written "
"as a one-line expression, and a spin box that allows you to specify how many"
" decimal places should be shown for the calculation results."
