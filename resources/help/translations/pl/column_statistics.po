"The column statistics dialog, launched from the file properties dialog or by"
" long-pressing a column header, shows summary statistics about the data in a"
" column.  Only data in rows that pass the current filter is included in the "
"calculations.  If it was launched from the file properties dialog, a "
"droplist at the top of the dialog allows you to select which column to view "
"statistics for; only columns in the current view are listed.  At the bottom "
"of the dialog is a widget which allows you to edit the display width (in "
"pixels) of that column in the current view.  If you close the dialog by "
"clicking \"OK\"/\"Done\", any changes you made to the column widths will be "
"applied."
