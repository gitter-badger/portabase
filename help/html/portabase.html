<a name="intro"><b>1)Introduction</b></a><br>
PortaBase is a small database program for creating, browsing, and editing
custom tables of data.  Typical uses are media inventories, reference
charts, etc.  Notable features include:<br>
<ul>
  <li>String, Integer, Decimal, Boolean, and Note (multi-line text) column
      types</li>
  <li>Custom data views (subsets of the columns in any order)</li>
  <li>Sort the rows by any combination of columns, each in ascending or
      descending order</li>
  <li>Page navigation buttons, with custom number of rows per page</li>
  <li>Add, delete, rearrange, and rename columns at any time</li>
  <li>Specify default values for columns</li>
  <li>View summary statistics for columns (total, average, min, max, etc.)</li>
  <li>Import data from CSV files</li>
  <li>Export data to CSV files</li>
</ul>
<a name="file"><b>2)File selector</b></a><br>
Unless the program was launched by clicking on a PortaBase file in the
Documents tab, the first screen shown will be the file selector.  The
"View" menu in the upper left allows you to select which category of
files to view.  You may proceed by either clicking on a file to select
it or by clicking the "New" icon in the upper right in order to create
a new PortaBase file.<br>
<br>
<a name="columns"><b>3)Columns editor</b></a><br>
Each PortaBase file contains one table of a user-defined format.  The
format of this table is determined by a sequence of data columns,
each of which has its own name, data type, and default value.
When creating a new PortaBase file, this dialog is shown so the data
columns can be defined.  The columns of an existing file can also be
edited at any time using this dialog by selecting the "Edit Columns"
item in the "File" menu of the <a href="#viewer">data viewer</a>.<br>
<br>
The current column definitions are displayed as rows in a list, in
the order in which they appear in the <a href="#rowedit">row editor</a>.
These column definitions are manipulated using the buttons at the bottom
of the dialog:<br>
<ul>
<li><i>Add</i> - Create a new column definition at the end of the
list.  A small dialog is shown which allows you to enter the name,
data type, and default value of the new column.  The default value
is what will be entered for this column in any already existing data
rows, and it will appear in the row editor when adding new rows as
well.</li>
<li><i>Edit</i> - Edit the currently selected column definition.
Note that the data type cannot be changed.  If the default value
is changed, the new default will appear in the row editor when
adding new rows; existing rows are unaffected.</li>
<li><i>Delete</i> - Delete the currently selected column definition.
All data stored in that column will be lost.</li>
<li><i>Up</i> - Move the currently selected column up one position
in the list (and hence in the row editor as well).</li>
<li><i>Down</i> - Move the currently selected column down one position
in the list (and hence in the row editor as well).</li>
</ul>
None of the changes made to the table format are applied until the
"OK" button is pressed; if the "X" button is pressed instead, the
changes are discarded and the file format is left as it was.  If the
"X" button is pressed while defining the columns of a new file, the
file creation is aborted; otherwise, pressing either of the dialog
closing buttons takes you to the <a href="#viewer">data viewer.</a><br>
<br>
<a name="viewedit"><b>4)View editor</b></a><br>
Whenever you browse a database's content in the <a href="#viewer">data
viewer</a>, you are looking at one "view" of the data.  A view is a
subset of the columns in the database, displayed in a particular order
and with specified display widths.  Each database has a default "All
Columns" view which shows all the columns in the database in the same
order as they appear in the <a href="rowedit">row editor</a>.<br>
<br>
Views are defined using the view editor dialog.  At the top of the
dialog is a text box containing the name of the view; changing this
renames the view.  Below that is a table showing the names of all the
columns in the database, with a checkbox next to each indicating whether
or not it is included in this view.  Click this checkbox to include or
exclude the column.  At the bottom of the dialog are "Up" and "Down"
buttons for moving the selected row up or down in the table, changing
the order of the columns in the view.  Click "OK" to accept the
currently shown settings or "X" to revert to the previous values (or to
cancel adding a new view).<br>
<br>
<a name="viewer"><b>5)Data viewer</b></a><br>
This is the main screen of the application, where you can browse the
database's content and launch most of the other dialogs.  The contents
of this screen are:<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="#navi">Rows display and navigation</a></li>
<li><a href="#labels">Column labels</a></li>
<li><a href="#filemenu">File menu</a></li>
<li><a href="#rowmenu">Row menu</a></li>
<li><a href="#viewmenu">View menu</a></li>
<li><a href="#sortmenu">Sort menu</a></li>
<li><a href="#toolbar">Toolbar buttons</a></li>
</ul>
<a name="navi"><i>Row display and navigation</i></a><br>
Most of the data viewer screen is occupied by a table showing one view
of a set of rows in the database.  The spin box at the bottom left of
the screen specifies the maximum number of rows to display at once for
the current view; you can edit this to be any positive integer (setting
it low enough eliminates the scrollbar on the right of the display
table, giving a little more horizontal space).  To the right of this
"rows per page" box are the page navigation buttons.  Click on one of
the numbered buttons to go to that page of rows; the current page is
shown pressed.  Click on the arrow buttons at the ends to show the
page buttons for the next or previous five pages.<br>
<br>
Clicking on a cell in the data display and holding down for 1/2 second
or longer before releasing executes special functions.  If you do this
on a cell in a Note column, the <a href="#noteedit">note viewer</a> is
displayed showing the content of that note.  If you do it in any other
type of column, the <a href="#rowedit">row editor</a> for the row you
clicked on is launched.<br>
<br>
<a name="labels"><i>Column labels</i></a><br>
The row of column labels has several features in addition to informing
you of the column names. To change the widths of the columns in the
current view, click on the border between two column labels (or the right
edge of the last column) and drag it to the desired location.  Clicking
on a column label sorts all the rows by the content of that column in
ascending order; clicking it again sorts in descending order.  If you
press a column label and hold it for half a second or more before releasing,
a dialog containing summary information for that column is displayed.<br>
<br>
<a name="filemenu"><i>File menu</i></a><br>
The "File" menu contains options that apply to the database file as a
whole.  These are:<br>
<ul>
<li><i>Save</i> - Save any changes that have been made since the file
was opened or last saved.  If you exit PortaBase without saving the most
recent changes, those changes will be lost (a dialog will warn you if
this is about to happen).  This option is disabled if no changes have been
made since the current database was opened or last saved.</li>
<li><i>Import</i> - Allows you to <a href="#import">import</a> rows from
a CSV file.</li>
<li><i>Export</i> - Allows you to <a href="#export">export</a> the
current database content to a CSV file.</li>
<li><i>Edit Columns</i> - Launches the <a href="#columns">columns
editor</a>.</li>
</ul>
<a name="rowmenu"><i>Row menu</i></a><br>
The "Row" menu contains options that let you manipulate rows of data.
These are:
<ul>
<li><i>Add</i> - Add a new row of data (by launching the
<a href="#rowedit">row editor</a>).</li>
<li><i>Edit</i> - Edit the currently selected row of data (again using
the <a href="#rowedit">row editor</a>).</li>
<li><i>Delete</i> - Delete the currently selected row of data.</li>
</ul>
<a name="viewmenu"><i>View menu</i></a><br>
The "View" menu allows you to select and manage views.  The top section
of this menu has three options:<br>
<ul>
<li><i>Add</i> - Add a new view to the database file.  Choosing this
option launches the view editor with no name specified and none of the
columns checked.</li>
<li><i>Edit</i> - Edit the currently displayed view.  Choosing this
option launches the view editor with the current view's name and column
sequence.  The "All Columns" view cannot be edited.</li>
<li><i>Delete</i> - Delete the currently displayed view and switch to
the "All Columns" view.  The "All Columns" view cannot be deleted.</li>
</ul>
Below these items in the menu is a list of all the views defined for the
current database, with a check next to the one currently displayed.  To
switch to a different view, simply select the one you want to see from
the menu.<br>
<br>
<a name="sortmenu"><i>Sort menu</i></a><br>
The "Sort" menu allows you to select and manage sorting configurations.
The top section of this menu has three options:<br>
<ul>
<li><i>Add</i> - Add a new sorting to the database file.  Choosing this
option launches the <a href="#sortedit">sorting editor</a> with no name
specified and none of the columns checked.</li>
<li><i>Edit</i> - Edit the currently used sorting (only available if a
named sorting is in use).  Choosing this option launches the sorting
editor with the current sorting's name and settings.</li>
<li><i>Delete</i> - Delete the currently used sorting (only available if
a named sorting is in use).</li>
</ul>
Below these items in the menu is a list of all the sortings defined for
the current database, with a check next to the one currently in use
(if any).  To change the way the rows are sorted, simply select the
sorting configuration you want to use from the menu.  If you just want
to sort by a single column that is displayed in the current view, it is
probably faster to use the "click on a column label to sort" feature
instead.<br>
<br>
<a name="toolbar"><i>Toolbar buttons</i></a><br>
There is a toolbar of four buttons that provide quick access to commonly
used operations.  These are:<br>
<ul>
<li><i>Save</i> - Same as "Save" in the <a href="#filemenu">File
menu</a>.</li>
<li><i>Add</i> - Same as "Add" in the <a href="#rowmenu">Row
menu</a>.</li>
<li><i>Edit</i> - Same as "Edit" in the <a href="#rowmenu">Row
menu</a>.</li>
<li><i>Delete</i> - Same as "Delete" in the <a href="#rowmenu">Row
menu</a>.</li>
</ul>
<a name="rowedit"><b>6)Row editor</b></a><br>
The row editor is shown whenever a row of data is added or edited.  It has
one row for each column in the database; on the left is the name of the
column, and on the right is its current value.  When adding a new row of
data, the default values are shown; when editing an existing row of data,
the current values are shown.  After editing the values as desired, click
"OK" to accept the currently displayed values, or "X" to cancel the row
addition (if adding a row) or leave the current values unchanged (if
editing a row).<br>
<br>
<a name="noteedit"><b>7)Note editor/viewer</b></a><br>
The "Note" column type is for blocks of text which may contain multiple
lines (as opposed to the "String" type, which is better suited for
relatively short single lines of text).  The larger size of the content
of such columns merits its own (very simple) dialog.  Both in the row
editor and in the default value section of the column editor, a Note
value is shown as a button containing a note icon and the beginning of
the Note's content (as much as will fit).  To see and/or change the
full text, press this button; a full-screen text editor dialog will
appear, showing the current text of the Note.  Click "OK" to accept any
changes you have made or "X" to revert to the original content.<br>
<br>
Note columns are treated a little specially in the data viewer also.
The column label for Note columns contains a note icon indicating that
it is not just a String column.  The cells in the column each show as much
of the Note content as will fit.  If you press on one of these cells
and hold for half a second or longer before releasing, a read-only version
of the Note editor is shown.  Click either "OK" or "X" to dismiss it and
return to the data viewer.<br>
<br>
<a name="sortedit"><b>8)Sorting editor</b></a><br>
Clicking on a column label in the data viewer is a convenient way to
sort the database contents by a single column.  But sometimes you may want
to sort by a combination of columns; sort by the content of column A, within
groups of the same value of A sort by the content of column B, etc.  To do
this or to sort by a column that isn't shown in the current view, you need
to define a named sorting.<br>
<br>
Sortings are defined using the sorting editor dialog, which is very
similar to the <a href="#viewedit">view editor</a> dialog.  At the top of
the dialog is a text box containing the name of the sorting; changing this
renames the sorting.  Below that is a table showing the names of all the
columns in the database, with a checkbox next to each indicating whether
or not it is to be sorted.  Click this checkbox to add or remove the column
from the set of ones to be sorted.  The third column in the table shows either
"Ascending" or "Descending" for checked rows, indicating which direction to
sort in; click this indicator to change it to the opposite value.  At the
bottom of the dialog are "Up" and "Down" buttons for moving the selected row
up or down in the table, changing the sequence in which the columns are
sorted.  The rows are sorted by the topmost checked column first, rows with
the same value in that column are sorted by the next highest checked column,
etc.  Click "OK" to accept the currently shown settings or "X" to revert
to the previous values (or to cancel adding a new sorting).<br>
<br>
<a name="import"><b>9)Data import</b></a><br>
PortaBase can import rows of data from CSV (Comma-Separated Value) files.
This allows you to import data exported from a spreadsheet or another
database program.  To do this:<br>
<ol>
<li>Open the PortaBase file you want to import the data into.  If you
wish to import the data into a new file, create a new file and
define a column structure that matches that of the data to be imported.</li>
<li>From the "File" menu in the <a href="#viewer">data viewer</a>, select
"Import".  A file selector will appear showing all the CSV files that
are available; pick the one you want to import from.  The CSV file must have
the same number of columns as the open database file, and the values in
those columns must be appropriate for the specified column types.</li>
<li>The rows in the imported file are added to the database.  Rows from
other files can be added by repeating this process, or another copy of the
same rows can be added by importing the same file again.</li>
</ol>
<a name="export"><b>10)Data export</b></a><br>
PortaBase can also export database rows to CSV files.  The inverse of data
import, this allows you to move database content into a spreadsheet or
other database program for further manipulation (among other uses).  To
export the current database's contents:<br>
<ol>
<li>Select "Export" from the "File" menu in the data viewer.</li>
<li>Enter the name of the CSV file you wish to create.</li>
<li>Click "OK" to complete the export, or the "X" button to cancel the
operation.</li>
</ol>
