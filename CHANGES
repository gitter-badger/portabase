2002-11-10  JMB  Date columns, crash fixes, toolbar changes

    Added support for date columns; values are entered using a calendar
    widget.

    Fixed bugs in the data viewer, sorting editor, and view editor which
    could cause a crash if you clicked in the wrong place.

    Due to space considerations, made some changes to the menus and
    toolbar.  The "Find" menu was renamed "Filter", and the "Find"
    toolbar button was moved to the "Quick" option under the "Filter"
    menu.

2002-11-09  JMB  Filtering, "All Columns" sequence bugfix

    Added the "Find" menu, providing support for multiple-condition
    filters using an interface very similar to that of views and sortings.
    Removed the "Row" menu in order to make room for it.

    Also added the "Find" toolbar button, which is a faster way to create
    a 1-condition temporary filter.

    Fixed a bug introduced by the "All Columns" view updating feature that
    caused a crash when creating a new database.

2002-11-01  JMB  Improved Note field display, update "All Columns" sequence

    Note fields are now shown as intended in the data viewer; as many
    characters from the start of the note as will fit are shown, with
    linebreaks converted to spaces.  In 1.1 only one row of the note was
    being shown, and not necessarily the first one.

    The "All Columns" view now tracks changes to the sequence of columns so
    it matches the order in the columns editor and row editor.

2002-10-30  JMB  Dialog resizing, save enable/disable, hold on row to edit

    All full-screen dialogs should now resize correctly when input methods
    are hidden or shown.

    The save icon and menu item are now enabled only when there are unsaved
    changes.  (Including changes of view, sorting, rows per page, etc.)

    Pressing and holding on a row in the data viewer for 1/2 second or
    longer now launches the row editor (except if you press in a Note
    column; this still shows the Note viewer).

2002-10-28  JMB  Multiple column sorting

    Added support for sorting on multiple columns.

2002-10-26  JMB  Note column type, minor bugfixes

    Added support for "Note" columns (a.k.a. multi-line text fields).

    Count change of view to "All Columns" as a change that the user should
    be prompted to save before closing.

    Removed help file sentence about ".csv" being appended to export files;
    true in the test environment, but apparently not on the Zaurus.

2002-10-22  JMB  View editor crash bugfix

    Fixed a crash that occurred when saving changes to an existing view.

2002-10-21  JMB  Fixed CSV export

    The text/x-csv directory is now created if it doesn't exist, and a
    ".desktop" file is created so the CSV file appears in the Documents tab.
