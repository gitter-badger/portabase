2002-10-30  JMB  Dialog resizing, save enable/disable, hold on row to edit

    All full-screen dialogs should now resize correctly when input methods
    are hidden or shown.

    The save icon and menu item are now enabled only when there are unsaved
    changes.  (Including changes of view, sorting, rows per page, etc.)

    Pressing and holding on a row in the data viewer for 1/2 second or
    longer now launches the row editor (except if you press in a Note
    column; this still shows the Note viewer).

    Added support for sorting on multiple columns.

2002-10-26  JMB  Note column type, minor bugfixes

    Added support for "Note" columns (a.k.a. multi-line text fields).

    Count change of view to "All Columns" as a change that the user should
    be prompted to save before closing.

    Removed help file sentence about ".csv" being appended to export files;
    true in the test environment, but apparently not on the Zaurus.

    Fixed a crash that occurred when saving changes to an existing view.

2002-10-21  JMB  Fixed CSV export

    The text/x-csv directory is now created if it doesn't exist, and a
    ".desktop" file is created so the CSV file appears in the Documents tab.
